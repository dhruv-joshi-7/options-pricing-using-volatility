# Options Pricing using Realized Volatility

When you try and buy options they are usually priced according to their underlying volatility.
Hence it is necessary to compare volatility before buying options

Here's how I have gone about this project:

• Get price data
• Compute realized volatility
• Build volatility cones of realized volatility
• Use cones to determine if the current realized volatility is cheap
